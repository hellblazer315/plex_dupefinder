## Dry Run Option

The dry run option allows users to simulate the deletion process without actually deleting any files. This option is configured using the `DRY_RUN` parameter in the `config.json` file. When enabled, Plex Dupefinder will log potential delete operations without carrying them out.

Users can also pass the `--dry-run` parameter from the command line to temporarily activate this feature.

## Preventing Plex Optimized Versions

Plex Optimized Versions are automatically excluded from consideration as duplicates. This enhancement improves the accuracy of duplicate detection by excluding files that Plex has optimized for streaming.

However, to address rare instances where Plex incorrectly identifies files as non-optimized versions, users can configure the application to exclude files located under the "Plex Versions" folder from duplicate consideration. This option is controlled by the `SKIP_PLEX_VERSIONS_FOLDER` parameter in the `config.json` file. Media files under the "Plex Versions" folder will be ignored during duplicate identification, providing an additional layer of accuracy to the duplicate detection process.

## Handling Unavailable Media Files

The application now has the ability to remove entries from Plex for media files marked as 'Unavailable'. This functionality is controlled by the `FIND_UNAVAILABLE` parameter in the `config.json` file. Plex Dupefinder will attempt to delete the entry associated with unavailable media files, excluding cases where Plex reports a file size for an unavailable file. This precautionary measure prevents accidental deletion of valid files.

## Deleting Extra .TS Files

A new option, `FIND_EXTRA_TS`, allows users to delete all `.TS` files when a non-`.TS` file is present in the duplicate list. This feature is particularly useful for cleaning up recordings when a higher-quality, non-recorded version is available. By enabling this option, users can ensure that their media library remains clutter-free and optimized for better-quality content.

## Skipping Other Duplicate Checks (Batch Mode)

The `SKIP_OTHER_DUPES` option in the `config.json` file enables users to skip other duplicate checks when not using the `AUTO_DELETE` option. This allows features like `FIND_UNAVAILABLE` and `FIND_OTHER_TS` to be run in batch mode or on a scheduled task unattended, enhancing the flexibility and automation capabilities of Plex Dupefinder.

Alternatively, users can pass the `--skip-other-dupes` parameter from the command line to temporarily activate this feature.

## Docker Image Support

A Dockerfile is provided with Plex Dupefinder, allowing users to build a local image for running Plex Dupefinder instead of installing additional software locally. This enhances portability and simplifies the deployment process, enabling users to run Plex Dupefinder in various environments without additional dependencies. For detailed instructions on building and using the Docker image, please see `Dockerfile_README.md`.

## Additional Scoring Options

Three additional options (`SCORE_VIDEOBITRATE`, `SCORE_AUDIOCHANNELS`, and `VIDEO_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER`) have been added in the `config.json` that allow customization of how each of those metadata components impact the score of an item. 

`SCORE_AUDIOCHANNELS` is the simplest with a simple true/false definition that adds score value based on the number of audio channels that exist in the file or not. 

`VIDEO_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER` is the next simplest as it enables adjusting just how much the height (i.e. the "1080" in a 1920x1080 resolution video) impacts the overall score. This allows for example a 1920x1080 video that is otherwise similar to a 1920x800 video to score much higher. The default & original value for this attribute is 2.

`SCORE_VIDEOBITRATE` combines both of these aspects into a single dictionary definiton. This can easily be toggled off entirely by changing **enabled** to `false` or the multiplier can be adjusted from the default setting of `2` if desired.

## Activity Log Date & Timezone

The `activity.log` file now tracks the date of every line as well as the timezone defined in the `config.json` file. The default value is UTC which mirrors the original script's functionality, if you would like to see the logs reported in a different timezone (such as the one your server is hosted in), update the `LOGGING_TIMEZONE` config value to match the **TZ_Identifier** from the table in [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). This will properly align with any shifts for daylight savings time.

## Radarr Support

Added support to use Radarr as the file selector. This is most useful if you have custom scoring formats (such as those from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/)) for your Radarr installation already defined, allowing you to use those configurations rather than having to recreate the same or different settings in this tool.

When the `RADARR` setting has the **enabled** option set to `true`, Plex Dupefinder will use the configured **url** and **api_key** to query Radarr for which file it has imported for a given movie.

If `AUTO_DELETE` is enabled, the file Radarr has on record will be the default selection. If the connection to Radarr fails or there is otherwise an issue it will fallback to the standard scoring method. If `AUTO_DELETE` is disabled, the file Radarr has on record will be marked with a ‚≠ê and using the "r" option will auto-select the Radarr determined file.
